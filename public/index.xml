      <description>[Email] me@ethan-hanlon.xyz Probably the best way to reach me. [LinkedIn] https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-hanlon-6688491a6/ I accept connections with people I&amp;rsquo;ve met or had enough interaction with to consider a professional contact. [Discord] If we&amp;rsquo;re scheduled to meet, you can email me for my Discord. I try to keep it for people who really need to communicate with me that way. [Social Media] See about page I usually respond to DMs, but would prefer to talk through email if you&amp;rsquo;re reaching out of the blue.</description>

Markup Master [Status] Soon to be live [Platform] Web [Website] https://markupmaster.xyz [Discord] https://discord.gg/Ar3vguwN3f Markup Master is a GPT-Based HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generator. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty awesome system - you just tell it what you want to make (for example, &amp;ldquo;A pong clone&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;A blog with a modern UI&amp;rdquo;) and it builds you all the code you need to get started.</description>
