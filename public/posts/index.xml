      <description>Blockchain. Even if you aren‚Äôt big into tech like I am, you can‚Äôt have been on the internet in the past two-and-a-half years without hearing about web3 this or NFT that. That web3 word is important, and I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on that here; if you ask blockchain bros, it‚Äôs the next iteration of the web as a whole ‚Äì in just a few short years, technology based on this concept will radically change the internet as we know it, creating a new ‚Äúdecentralized internet‚Äù that will replace the way we do everything from banking, shopping, gaming, entertainment, and even interactions with government entities.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain&#34;&gt;Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you aren‚Äôt big into tech like I am, you can‚Äôt have been on the internet in the past two-and-a-half years without hearing about web3 this or NFT that. That web3 word is important, and I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on that here; if you ask blockchain bros, it‚Äôs the next iteration of the web as a whole ‚Äì in just a few short years, technology based on this concept will radically change the internet as we know it, creating a new ‚Äúdecentralized internet‚Äù that will replace the way we do everything from banking, shopping, gaming, entertainment, and even interactions with government entities. All public, all on the blockchain. This stance runs into several problems, not least of which being the convolutedness of this technology, down to the very word blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the purposes of this article, I will not be focusing on the technological merits of blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;, as much as that will probably annoy some readers. I&amp;rsquo;ll get to those another time. I want to focus on the &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;, our &lt;em&gt;end users&lt;/em&gt; as computer scientists and software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;big-words-hurt-my-brain-&#34;&gt;Big Words Hurt my Brain :(&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that underpin our modern society that, while you may not know the intricate complexities of them, you can still tell what‚Äôs going on in the big picture based even just on the words. If I say trade is something that underpins society, you can understand that based on your own experiences of trading with people. If I say leadership is an important societal trait, you can extrapolate how that works based on your own experiences leading or being lead. This extends to the internet itself ‚Äì read each syllable literally and you get &lt;em&gt;interconnected [computer] network&lt;/em&gt;. Even if you don‚Äôt understand what a computer network is, you can still understand what‚Äôs happening thanks to your own understanding of how people network with each other ‚Äì an interconnected computer network is just a bunch of computers all around the world talking to each other. Of course, if you understand computer networking at a complex level, you‚Äôll know there‚Äôs more to it than that, but if you‚Äôre approaching this as someone who‚Äôs technically illiterate you can guesstimate to a reasonably accurate degree what‚Äôs going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to apply this same exercise with blockchain and it falls apart. Society is supposed to be underpinned on blocks being chained? What are these blocks, and why do they have to be chained together? In what way are they chained? Now, these questions do of course have answers, and I know these answers personally, but the fact that even a technically literate person would need to ask these questions to get an ‚Äúinternet is just a bunch of computers talking to each other‚Äù level of understanding is pause for caution. It certainly doesn‚Äôt help that you need to have a solid multi-year understanding of advanced computer science and mathematics topics to understand what‚Äôs really happening at a more profound level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so&#34;&gt;So?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one doesn‚Äôt need to know the minutiae of hashing algorithms and cryptography to use web3 tech, but the fact that one can‚Äôt even get an elementary understanding of the technology without being primed with years of technological research is cause for caution. How is one supposed to make informed, rational decisions on this hypothetical internet without even knowing the first thing about how it works, and, more importantly, how it‚Äôs different from web2.0. &lt;strong&gt;For all the talk of creating a ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù internet&lt;/strong&gt; (which, when factoring the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-one-percent-controls-lions-share-of-the-cryptocurrencys-wealth-11639996204&#34;&gt;wealth inequality of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;, wouldn‚Äôt even be practically decentralized anyway), &lt;strong&gt;the knowledge of how best to utilize this technology would be in the hands of a small privileged few, moreso than it is today.&lt;/strong&gt; While none of this is to necessarily say that blockchain has zero use cases, it should be disqualifying regarding the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/crypto-absurd.html&#34;&gt;Austrian school-based pipe dream&lt;/a&gt; of making everything on the internet run on blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally at this point I would discuss the way cloud computing services have made access to the internet cheaper and more democratized than ever, which it has, but that would fall out of the scope of this post. What I really want to point out is that, more and more, the internet is being used by people who haven‚Äôt necessarily been with computers their whole lives. Once upon a 1990‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs, the world wide web was, in our cultural zeitgeist at least, seen as the domain of spunky young teenagers. These days, however, that is no longer the case. According to Pew Research Center, in the year 2000, 52% of US adults used the internet. In 2021 that number grew to 93%. Among the largest rise of internet users has been among people over the age of 65 ‚Äì from 14% to 75% using the internet in the same timeframe. This is true of other characteristics who weren‚Äôt seen as often on the internet around the millennium ‚Äì rural communities, nonwhite racial groups, and lower income people have seen similar increases in internet penetration. More people are making their voices heard on the internet, and now is not the time to shut them out by rewriting the web from under their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essay is the first in a series of articles I will be writing over the next ü§∑ü§∑ exploring blockchain, its socioeconomic and political ramifications, and some potential use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
