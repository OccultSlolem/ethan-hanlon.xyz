# Hi there

My name is Ethan Hanlon and this is my personal blog, sudo chown ethan-hanlon. I'll use it to talk about whatever stuff is on my mind - technical stuff, thoughts, travels, whatnot. I'll try to post weekly updates, so definitely stay tuned.

I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University and I have a passion for using programming to build cool stuff and advance justice in the world. I'm a fellowship candidate at the SFSU Innovation Entrepeneurship Fellowship Program, which allowed me to found my own company, Politifi (https://politifi.io)\.

I also have interests in music, WGI color guard, gamining, and other stuff. I'll be posting about whatever interests me :)

If you want to follow my travels and exploits, definitely follow me:
