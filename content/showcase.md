Here's some of the stuff I've made. I'll update this as I go along.

## Markup Master

Markup Master is a GPT-Based HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generator. It's a pretty awesome system - you just tell it what you want to make (for example, "A pong clone" or "A blog with a modern UI") and it builds you all the code you need to get started. It's all in vanilla, so you don't need to fuss around with frameworks or anything to get started, though I plan to add support for creating websites on the React, Vue, and (my personal favorite) Svelte frameworks in the near future.

I built this thing because I can tell you from experience that it is so  easy to fall into creative block when you're starting to build a website. I built a [very rough version](https://devpost.com/software/leviathan-fe6g7l) of the system over a weekend for Stanford's TreeHacks hackathon and have since refined it into the version it is today. While it is still in beta, I plan to add more features including additional frameworks to build for, deploying websites straight from the service, and creating a repository for you to put straight into your GitHub or Git provider of your choice.

## SQLHammer

SQLHammer is a command line tool written in Python that can take a given template and structure a SQLite database around it. The real kicker is that you can insert mathematical models and introduce random variance into your data. This is a tool I built for a project I was working on at work, and I figured it would be useful to others as well.


## Politifi

Politifi is the biggest project I'm working on right now, and the only closed-source thing I'm doing at the moment.

There's a major problem in American politics these days: local, tribal, and state governments, which make a lot of the decisions that impact us day-to-day, simply don't receive the attention they deserve in our social consciousness. Despite the efforts of many talented journalists and politicians, they simply don't receive the attention they should. This is where Politifi comes in. To passerby, I usually describe Politifi as "Political Tinder," but there's much more to it than that. Politifi has a dual goal: to connect voters with political candidates, and to connect politicians with new voters, donors, and volunteers.

Politifi ran a test service for the Spring 2021 SFSU Associated Students election. Since then, I've taken it off the App Store while I do major renovations to the app.

Politifi is owned by Politifi, Inc., of which I serve as its CEO.

## PediaTrac
- **[Status]** Complete
- **[Platform]** iOS
- **[GitHub]** https://github.com/OccultSlolem/PediaTrac-iOS

PediaTrac is a project I made for the 2021 SF Hacks Hackathon. I had to make it in less than 12 hours, since my team abandoned me on the second night of the competition. PediaTrac helps parents find out when they need to take their children into the pediatrician for their vaccines. If I ever return to this project, I'd add an app icon, push/email notifications, and more theming.
