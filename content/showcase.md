Here's some of the stuff I've made. I'll update this as I go along.

## Politifi

**[Status]** In Progress

**[Platform]** iOS, Android, Web

**[Website]** https://politifi.io

**[GitHub]** https://github.com/Politifi

Politifi is the biggest project I'm working on right now, and the only closed-source thing I'm doing at the moment.

There's a major problem in American politics these days: local, tribal, and state governments, which make a lot of the decisions that impact us day-to-day, simply don't receive the attention they deserve in our social consciousness. Despite the efforts of many talented journalists and politicians, they simply don't receive the attention they should. This is where Politifi comes in. To passerby, I usually describe Politifi as "Political Tinder," but there's much more to it than that. Politifi has a dual goal: to connect voters with political candidates, and to connect politicians with new voters, donors, and volunteers.

Politifi ran a test service for the Spring 2021 SFSU Associated Students election. Since then, I've taken it off the App Store while I do major renovations to the app.

Politifi is owned by Politifi, Inc., of which I serve as its CEO.

## PediaTrac
**[Status]** Complete, may return to later

**[Platform]** iOS

**[GitHub]** https://github.com/OccultSlolem/PediaTrac-iOS

PediaTrac is a project I made for the 2021 SF Hacks Hackathon. I had to make it in less than 12 hours, since my team abandoned me on the second night of the competition. PediaTrac helps parents find out when they need to take their children into the pediatrician for their vaccines. If I ever return to this project, I'd add an app icon, push/email notifications, and more theming.

## OpenBowler
**[Status]** Just starting out

**[Platform]** macOS, tvOS

**[GitHub]** https://github.com/OccultSlolem/OpenBowler

I worked at a bowling alley in my hometown for about 6 months and had the idea to rewrite the Brunswick bowling software suite for Apple platforms. The idea is to have a control desk and back desk program running on macOS, and scorers running on tvOS.

## OpenBonCalendrier

**[Status]** Just starting out

**[Platform]** iOS, iPadOS

**[GitHub]** https://github.com/OccultSlolem/OpenBonCalendrier

I don't like any of the free scheduler apps on the App Store and I don't feel like paying money for one, so I decided to write my own instead. You'll be able to keep track of when you need to be in class, get reminders for homework, and track other school stuff.
